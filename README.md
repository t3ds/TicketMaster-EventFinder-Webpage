This is my implementation of an EventFinder website made in HTML, CSS, JavaScript with a Flask Backend.

Flask is used to fetch events, individual event details and venue details from ticketmaster using an API and then everything is displayed on the front-end.

On the user side, the user has a form where they can input a keyword, distance, type of event as well as the location (auto detect location is available too).
